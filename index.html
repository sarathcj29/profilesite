          <p>
            I started learning to code during my high school as part of my

            got placed in an MNC to take full time job. My expertise include
            database (Oracle, SQLServer & Mongo) and programming
            language/scripting include (Delphi - Pascal, C#, JS, HTML, CSS)

          <h3>Enterpise Application</h3>
          <p>
            Over my experience, i have worked with Service company and Product
            company which gave more insight on the enterprise application from
            customer/client POV. Writing scallable code and working in complete
